[Check out the Imgur album for some screenshots!](//imgur.com/a/m5Rxw) - [PS+ Support!](//imgur.com/a/46K6L)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n=====\r\n* One convenient list of all your content!\r\n* View, sort, and filter your download list as you desire!\r\n* **PS+ support:** easily see what is and isn't tied to your subscription.\r\n* **Download queue support:** easily send items where you want.\r\n* **Export your list** in a database/spreadsheet format (CSV) to use as you like!\r\n* Lightweight, portable, consistent: computer or mobile, always the same experience.\r\n* **Mobile!** Even on-the-go, don't settle for a featureless download list! ([YMMV](# \"Your mileage may vary.\"))\r\n* Open source! (MIT) (Totally a feature.)\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n**Grease/Tamper/etcmonkey users:** [Get the user script](//repod.github.io/psdle/psdle.user.js) then go to the download list.    \r\n\r\n**Bookmarklet:** [Get it here!](//repod.github.io/psdle/bookmarklet.html) (Works on iOS, possibly Android.)\r\n\r\n**Everyone else:**\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the desired account's download page from the online store\r\n2. Ensure the displayed page is the first (top has latest purchase)\r\n3. Open the Web Console (Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+K) (Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+J)\r\n4. Input **$.getScript(\"https://repod.github.io/psdle/psdle.js\");** \r\n5. Execute (Enter) and let the magic happen\r\n\r\n**Bleeding edge users:**\r\n\r\nThe repository files will always be the latest possible versions, excluding forks/branches/etc. Feel free to give them a try.\r\nIf you get an error involving strict MIME checking, run the URL through something like [RawGit](//rawgit.com/).\r\n\r\nWhat Needs To Be Done\r\n=====\r\n* Improve appearance.\r\n* **Translations!** Language code (\"en-us\") and JSON format required. See source or contact me.\r\n* Make it faster! How? How indeed. (Always in progress)\r\n* Iron out problems with APIs. (Various degress of progress)\r\n* Improve Download Queue.\r\n* Custom-make the gh-pages branch page to remove useless links (downloading the zip).\r\n\r\nIssues: [Submit](//github.com/RePod/psdle/issues) - [PS+](//github.com/RePod/psdle/issues/3).\r\n\r\nPotentially Asked Questions\r\n=====\r\n#####Is this safe or a ploy to phish account details?\r\n**Yes it is safe, no it is not for phishing account details.**    \r\nI put it on GitHub for a reason, feel free to view the ~~horribly effective~~ code yourself and decide.    \r\nIf/when I get pull requests I'll let them sit and look through them while allowing the [\"community\"](# \"What community?\") to as well.\r\n\r\nIf authentication details were left around openly on the download list page I would take my concerns elsewhere.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=====\r\nMIT, have fun.\r\n\r\n**PSDLE is not sponsored, endorsed, or created by Sony, SNEI, SCEA, SCEE, SCEI, or affiliates.**\r\n**Third-party content (icons, names) re-rendered by PSDLE is provided from the download list.**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
