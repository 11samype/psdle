[Check out the Imgur album for some screenshots!](http://imgur.com/a/m5Rxw)\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n**Grease/Tamper/etcmonkey users:** [Get the user script](https://repod.github.io/psdle/psdle.user.js) then go to the download list.    \r\n\r\n**Everyone else:**\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the desired account's download page from the online store\r\n2. Ensure the displayed page is the first (top has latest purchase)\r\n3. Open the Web Console (Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+K) (Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+J)\r\n4. Input **$.getScript(\"https://repod.github.io/psdle/psdle.js\");** \r\n5. Execute (Enter) and let the magic happen\r\n\r\n**Bleeding edge users:**\r\n\r\nThe repository files will always be the latest possible versions, excluding forks/branches/etc. Feel free to give them a try.\r\nIf you get an error involving strict MIME checking, run the URL through something like [RawGit](http://rawgit.com/).\r\n\r\nWhat Needs To Be Done\r\n=====\r\n* Improve appearance\r\n* **Translations!** Language code (\"en-us\") and JSON format required. See source or contact me.\r\n\r\nWhat Cannot Be Done\r\n=====\r\n* Adding the \"Download to X\" button, can't keep events.\r\n\r\nPotentially Asked Questions\r\n=====\r\n#####Why does it take so long to parse?\r\nPSDLE works by parsing each page of the download list one at a time with a delay inbetween. Currently a timeout of 3 seconds seems to hit the sweet spot of changing the page and detecting the content (on a reasonable connection and assuming the server isn't already dying).\r\n\r\nIf using the API, PSDLE waits for all requests to finish before proceeding.\r\n\r\nThis may change in the future.\r\n\r\n#####What difference does using the API make?\r\nUsing the API forces PSDLE to look \"behind the scenes\" to find more accurate information than what the download list provides.\r\nThis in turn allows it to offer different options (such as PS1/2 games) to filter by.\r\n\r\nNobody except the end-user will not be held responsible for problems that arise from using the API.\r\n\r\nAPI usage is currently early in its development so not everything may be detected properly.\r\n\r\n#####Why are PS1 classics/etc showing as PSP and PS2 classics as PS3?\r\nEnable deep search/use API on PSDLE startup.\r\n\r\n#####How can I exclude results that aren't touched by the system or tag filters?\r\nIn the search box make a regular expression to match what you want to exclude then attach /d as a mod.\r\n\r\nFor instance, /Avatar/id will exclude every instance of \"Avatar\" instead of only showing them. (/i is case in-sensitive)\r\n\r\nIf the box turns red when the search is executed, /d is working as it should.\r\n\r\n#####Why is this so horrible?\r\nAt the time of writing a concept version is available simply showing off what can be done.    \r\nFeel free to fork and submit pull requests.\r\n\r\n#####Why is this so good?\r\nI ask myself that every time I wake up.\r\n\r\n#####Does this work in any browser/my toaster's web browser?\r\nProbably, as long as it allows local Javascript execution.\r\n\r\n#####Is this safe or a ploy to phish account details?\r\n**Yes it is safe, no it is not for phishing account details.**    \r\nI put it on GitHub for a reason, feel free to view the ~~horribly effective~~ code yourself and decide.    \r\nIf and when I get pull requests I'll let them sizzle and look through them while allowing the \"community\" to as well.\r\n\r\nIf authentication details were left around openly on the download list page I would take my concerns elsewhere.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=====\r\nMIT, have fun.\r\n\r\n**PSDLE is not sponsored, endorsed, or created by Sony, SNEI, SCEA, SCEE, SCEI, or affiliates.**\r\n**Third-party content (icons, names) re-rendered by PSDLE is provided from the download list.**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
