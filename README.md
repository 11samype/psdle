=====

Improving everyone's favorite online download list, one loop at a time.

This is the PSDLE **repository**! Most of the information you'll be looking for is on **[the website.](//repod.github.io/psdle "To the website!")**    
Those with no interest of the inner workings of PSDLE **will not find anything new here**!


Usage
=====
**Bleeding edge users:**

The repository files will always be the latest possible versions, excluding forks/branches/etc. Feel free to give them a try.
If you get an error involving strict MIME checking, run the URL through something like [RawGit](//rawgit.com/).

What Needs To Be Done
=====
* Improve appearance.
* **Translations!** Language code ("en-us") and JSON format required. See source or contact me.
* Make it faster! How? How indeed. (Always in progress)
* Iron out problems with APIs. (Various degrees of progress)
* Improve Download Queue.

Submitting a Bug or Translation: [Submit](//github.com/RePod/psdle/wiki/Submit-a-Bug-or-Translation) **/** [PS+](//github.com/RePod/psdle/issues/3).
