<p><strong>Grease/Tamper/etcmonkey users:</strong> <a href="//repod.github.io/psdle/psdle.user.js">Get the user script</a> then go to the download list.    </p>

<p><strong>Bookmarklet:</strong> <a href="//repod.github.io/psdle/bookmarklet.html">Get it here!</a> (Works on iOS, possibly Android.)</p>

<p><strong>Everyone else:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Navigate to the desired account's download page from the online store</li>
<li>Ensure the displayed page is the first (top has latest purchase)</li>
<li>Open the Web Console (Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+K) (Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+J)</li>
<li>Input <strong>$.getScript("<a href="https://repod.github.io/psdle/psdle.js%22">https://repod.github.io/psdle/psdle.js"</a>);</strong> </li>
<li>Execute (Enter) and let the magic happen</li>

<h5>
<a name="is-this-safe-or-a-ploy-to-phish-account-details" class="anchor" href="#is-this-safe-or-a-ploy-to-phish-account-details"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Is this safe or a ploy to phish account details?</h5>

<p><strong>Yes it is safe, no it is not for phishing account details.</strong><br>
I put it on GitHub for a reason, feel free to view the <del>horribly effective</del> code yourself and decide.<br>
If and when I get pull requests I'll let them sizzle and look through them while allowing the "community" to as well.</p>

<p>If authentication details were left around openly on the download list page I would take my concerns elsewhere.</p>

<h5>
<a name="does-this-support-ps-titles" class="anchor" href="#does-this-support-ps-titles"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Does this support PS+ titles?</h5>

<p>Yes, or tries to, listing them as normal as well as distinguishing them from other entries with a yellow background.</p>

<p>Report any issues <a href="//github.com/RePod/psdle/issues/3">here</a>.</p>

<h5>
<a name="what-difference-does-using-the-apis-make" class="anchor" href="#what-difference-does-using-the-apis-make"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What difference does using the APIs make?</h5>

<p>The <strong>Game API</strong> (deep search) accesses individual game information to enhance results (detecting PS1/2 games, demos, etc.).</p>

<p>The <strong>Entitlements API</strong> accesses the user's entitlement (purchases) information to determine PS+ titles.</p>

<p>All API usage is optional, they're used only to enhance the experience </p>

<p>End-users are to be held responsible for problems that arise from using the API.<br>
API usage is currently early in its development so not everything may be detected properly.</p>

<h5>
<a name="why-are-ps1-classicsetc-showing-as-psp-and-ps2-classics-as-ps3" class="anchor" href="#why-are-ps1-classicsetc-showing-as-psp-and-ps2-classics-as-ps3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why are PS1 classics/etc showing as PSP and PS2 classics as PS3?</h5>

<p>Enable deep search/use API on PSDLE startup.</p>

<h5>
<a name="how-can-i-exclude-results-that-arent-touched-by-the-system-or-tag-filters" class="anchor" href="#how-can-i-exclude-results-that-arent-touched-by-the-system-or-tag-filters"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How can I exclude results that aren't touched by the system or tag filters?</h5>

<p>In the search box make a regular expression to match what you want to exclude then attach /d as a mod.</p>

<p>For instance, /Avatar/id will exclude every instance of "Avatar" instead of only showing them. (/i is case-insensitive)</p>

<p>If the box turns red when the search is executed, /d is working as it should.</p>

<h5>
<a name="why-does-it-take-so-long-to-parse" class="anchor" href="#why-does-it-take-so-long-to-parse"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why does it take so long to parse?</h5>

<p>PSDLE works by parsing each page of the download list one at a time with a delay inbetween. Currently a timeout of 3 seconds seems to hit the sweet spot of changing the page and detecting the content (on a reasonable connection and assuming the server isn't already dying).</p>

<p>If using the API, PSDLE waits for all requests to finish before proceeding.</p>

<p>This may change in the future.</p>

<h5>
<a name="why-is-this-so-horrible" class="anchor" href="#why-is-this-so-horrible"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is this so horrible?</h5>

<p>Functionally, PSDLE is complete. If you have suggestions make them known!<br>
Feel free to fork and submit pull requests.</p>

<h5>
<a name="why-is-this-so-good" class="anchor" href="#why-is-this-so-good"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is this so good?</h5>

<p>I ask myself that every time I wake up.</p>

<h5>
<a name="does-this-work-in-any-browsermy-toasters-web-browser" class="anchor" href="#does-this-work-in-any-browsermy-toasters-web-browser"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Does this work in any browser/my toaster's web browser?</h5>

<p>Probably, as long as it allows local Javascript execution.</p>

<h5>
<a name="how-do-i-contribute" class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-contribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do I contribute?</h5>

<p>Unfortunately due to the single-file nature of PSDLE (due to browser restrictions) merging forks will be impossible, if not very difficult by only merging one fork at a time and having others sync to master.</p>

<p>Remote JSON is out of the question (original intent for translations) due to cross-domain policies and *monkey variants run the script in an anonymous function/"sandbox" (preventing external interactions) for security, which I do not plan on bypassing.</p>

<p>If there's one main category of what PSDLE needs contributions for: translations. I would like to see PSDLE offer at least every language the store offers (and possibly more!).</p>

<p>If this doesn't sound like the way it should be done feel free to rewrite it, maybe it'll be better for everyone.</p>
